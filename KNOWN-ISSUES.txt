Known Issues for Employee Sample CRUD App
Version: 1.1

1.) This issue occurs when the app is run in CRUD mode (i.e. no submit). If user adds a new record, the EmpNum field is created on 
Backend, and returned to client. But the EmpNum is not always displayed in the controls after the “Save” button is selected.
